 * This is a manifest file that'll be compiled into application.css.
 *
 * With Propshaft, assets are served efficiently without preprocessing steps. You can still include
 * application-wide styles in this file, but keep in mind that CSS precedence will follow the standard
 * cascading order, meaning styles declared later in the document or manifest will override earlier ones,
 * depending on specificity.
 *
 * Tailwind CSS (loaded via CDN in the layout) now provides most layout and component styles.
 * Use this file only for very small overrides or utilities that don't fit well as Tailwind classes.
